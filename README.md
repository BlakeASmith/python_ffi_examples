# Python C-ffi Examples

This is an attempt to evaluate the various different methods of running C code from Python by writing trivial examples with each.

This is not intended to be an example of the "right" way to do things. I have quite  little experience in C, with most of my background in Java and Python. That being said, I hope reading through the examples here might be a faster way to get a surface level understanding of how to call C from Python.
